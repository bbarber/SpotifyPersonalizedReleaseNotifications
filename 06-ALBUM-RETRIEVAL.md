# 06 - Album Retrieval for Artists

## Overview
Fetch albums and EPs from Spotify for each artist in the combined artist list.

## Spotify API Details
- **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/{id}/albums`
- **Required Scope**: None (public data)
- **Parameters**:
  - `include_groups=album,single` (albums and singles/EPs)
  - `market=user's_market` (for regional availability)
  - `limit=50` (maximum per request)
  - `offset` (for pagination)

## Album Types in Spotify
- `album` - Full-length albums
- `single` - Singles and EPs (we'll filter EPs from singles later)
- `appears_on` - Compilations (exclude)
- `compilation` - Compilation albums (exclude)

## Data Structure
Each album object contains:
- `id` - Spotify album ID
- `name` - Album name
- `album_type` - 'album' or 'single'
- `total_tracks` - Number of tracks
- `release_date` - Release date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `artists[]` - Array of contributing artists
- `external_urls.spotify` - Direct link to album
- `images[]` - Album artwork

## Implementation Details

### Batch Processing
- Process artists in batches to manage API rate limits
- Add delays between artist requests
- Implement retry logic for failed requests
- Track progress for large artist lists

### Pagination Handling
- Handle pagination for prolific artists (50+ releases)
- Continue fetching until all albums retrieved
- Some artists may have hundreds of releases

### Rate Limiting Strategy
- Spotify allows 100 requests per minute
- With potential for 100s of artists, implement queuing
- Add configurable delays between requests
- Respect 429 rate limit responses

### Data Collection
- Collect all album data for later filtering
- Store raw album objects for processing
- Associate albums with their source artist

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create function to fetch albums for single artist
2. Implement pagination for artists with many albums
3. Create batch processing system for multiple artists
4. Add rate limiting and retry logic
5. Implement progress tracking and reporting
6. Handle API errors gracefully
7. Test with artists having varying album counts

## Success Criteria
- All albums retrieved for each tracked artist
- Pagination works correctly for prolific artists
- Rate limits are respected consistently
- Progress is visible during long operations
- API errors don't halt the entire process

## Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid artist IDs
- Rate limit exceeded (429)
- Spotify API downtime
- Artists with no albums
- Regional availability restrictions

## Performance Optimization
- Batch API requests efficiently
- Implement concurrent requests (with rate limiting)
- Cache artist album data within session
- Provide meaningful progress updates
- Handle timeouts gracefully

## Rate Limiting Implementation
```javascript
// Example rate limiting strategy
const REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE = 100;
const DELAY_BETWEEN_BATCHES = 60000; // 1 minute
const BATCH_SIZE = 10; // Process 10 artists at a time
```

## Data Validation
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Handle missing release dates
- Validate album type values
- Check for malformed URLs
