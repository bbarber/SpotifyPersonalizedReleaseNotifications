# 03 - Followed Artists Retrieval

## Overview
Retrieve the list of artists that the authenticated user follows on Spotify.

## Spotify API Details
- **Endpoint**: `GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/following`
- **Required Scope**: `user-follow-read`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `type=artist` (only fetch artists, not users)
  - `limit=50` (maximum per request)
  - `after` (pagination cursor)

## Data Structure
Each artist object contains:
- `id` - Spotify artist ID
- `name` - Artist display name
- `uri` - Spotify URI
- `external_urls.spotify` - Direct link to artist page
- `images` - Artist profile images
- `genres` - Array of genre strings
- `popularity` - Popularity score (0-100)

## Implementation Details

### Pagination Handling
- API returns maximum 50 artists per request
- Use `after` parameter for cursor-based pagination
- Continue fetching until no more results
- Collect all artists into single array

### Data Processing
- Extract essential fields: ID, name, Spotify URL
- Store in consistent format for later processing
- Handle missing or null fields gracefully

### Rate Limiting
- Respect Spotify's rate limits (100 requests per minute)
- Implement basic retry logic for 429 responses
- Add delays between paginated requests if needed

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create function to fetch single page of followed artists
2. Implement pagination loop to get all followed artists
3. Extract and normalize artist data
4. Add error handling for API failures
5. Implement rate limiting protection
6. Test with users having many followed artists

## Success Criteria
- All followed artists are retrieved successfully
- Pagination works correctly for users with 50+ followed artists
- Rate limits are respected
- API errors are handled gracefully
- Artist data is in consistent format

## Error Scenarios
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid or expired access token
- Rate limit exceeded (429 response)
- Spotify API downtime (5xx responses)
- User has no followed artists (empty result)

## Performance Considerations
- Minimize API requests through efficient pagination
- Cache results within single application run
- Handle large artist lists (some users follow 1000+ artists)
