# 09 - Error Handling and Edge Cases

## Overview
Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application to ensure graceful failures and helpful user feedback.

## Error Categories

### Authentication Errors
- **Invalid Credentials**: Wrong client ID or secret
- **User Denial**: User denies permission during OAuth
- **Token Expiration**: Access token expires during operation
- **Scope Issues**: Missing required permissions
- **Network Errors**: Connection issues during auth flow

### API Rate Limiting
- **Rate Limit Exceeded**: 429 responses from Spotify API
- **Daily Quota Exceeded**: API usage limits reached
- **Temporary Throttling**: Short-term rate limiting
- **Concurrent Request Limits**: Too many simultaneous requests

### Data Processing Errors
- **Empty Data Sets**: User has no followed artists or saved tracks
- **Malformed API Responses**: Invalid data from Spotify
- **Missing Required Fields**: Albums without essential data
- **Date Parsing Failures**: Invalid release date formats
- **Large Data Sets**: Memory or performance issues

### Network and Infrastructure
- **Connection Timeouts**: Slow or unreliable internet
- **DNS Resolution**: Network configuration issues
- **Spotify API Downtime**: Service unavailability
- **Partial Failures**: Some requests succeed, others fail

## Error Handling Strategy

### Graceful Degradation
- Continue processing when some operations fail
- Collect errors but don't halt execution
- Provide partial results when possible
- Log errors for debugging

### User-Friendly Messages
- Convert technical errors to readable messages
- Provide actionable suggestions where possible
- Avoid exposing internal error details
- Include relevant context (which artist, step, etc.)

### Retry Logic
```javascript
const retryWithBackoff = async (operation, maxRetries = 3) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      await delay(Math.pow(2, i) * 1000); // Exponential backoff
    }
  }
};
```

## Implementation Details

### Error Types and Responses
```javascript
class SpotifyAPIError extends Error {
  constructor(message, statusCode, endpoint) {
    super(message);
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.endpoint = endpoint;
  }
}
```

### Rate Limit Handling
- Detect 429 responses
- Extract retry-after headers
- Implement exponential backoff
- Queue requests when rate limited
- Provide user feedback during delays

### Partial Failure Management
- Track failed operations separately
- Continue with successful data
- Report summary of failures
- Allow manual retry of failed operations

## Error Recovery Strategies

### Authentication Recovery
- Detect expired tokens
- Automatically trigger re-authentication
- Preserve application state during re-auth
- Graceful fallback for auth failures

### API Failure Recovery
- Retry transient failures automatically
- Skip problematic artists/albums
- Use cached data when available
- Provide manual retry options

### Data Processing Recovery
- Handle missing or null fields
- Use default values where appropriate
- Skip malformed records
- Report data quality issues

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create custom error classes
2. Implement retry logic with backoff
3. Add rate limit detection and handling
4. Create user-friendly error messages
5. Implement partial failure collection
6. Add error logging and reporting
7. Test error scenarios comprehensively

## User Feedback for Errors

### Authentication Errors
```
❌ Authentication failed: Please check your Spotify credentials
   → Verify SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET in .env
   → Ensure redirect URI matches your Spotify app settings
```

### Rate Limiting
```
⏳ Rate limit reached. Waiting 60 seconds before continuing...
   → Spotify allows 100 requests per minute
   → Processing will resume automatically
```

### Partial Failures
```
⚠️  Some data could not be retrieved:
   → 3 artists failed to load albums (network errors)
   → 1 artist had no release data available
   → Showing results for 47 of 50 artists
```

## Success Criteria
- Application never crashes unexpectedly
- Users receive clear, actionable error messages
- Partial results are provided when possible
- Rate limits are handled transparently
- Network issues don't halt processing
- Failed operations can be retried

## Monitoring and Logging
- Log all errors with context
- Track error frequencies and patterns
- Monitor API response times
- Record rate limiting occurrences
- Report data quality issues

## Testing Strategy
- Test each error scenario individually
- Verify retry logic works correctly
- Confirm user messages are helpful
- Test recovery from partial failures
- Validate rate limiting behavior
